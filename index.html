	<! Introduction Paragraph>
	<p class="maintxt"> Welcome to this website! This website is for people who have or people who are helping some one else through cancer. Or any ailment for that matter. It is Important for everyone to talk about their mental health. The video below really emphasises this point. Mental health is something that is being brought to the for forefront of society. People going through illness have a higher likelyhood to have a bad mental health. In fact 1/3 Cancer patients experience a mental health concern, during or after treatment. The link between cancer specifically and mental health has been sutdied alot and is well understood. In fact it raises the total healthcare cost by 45% for some one with a prolonged condition. This is a cost that the patient doesnt have to worry about in ireland because Cancer treatment is free for all citizens. This website is made to be an extension of the Irish cancer society's website and documents some tactics that can be used to help prevent a dip in mental health. The header includes quick links to the different sections of the website for easy navigation. It also has links to places that can help with a person suffering from a dip in mental health or a prolongued illness. The final section on the header has a link to donate to the ICS and help support cancer research and its patients. Below you can finde a video describing how important it is to talk about mental health. After this you'll find a gallery describing the activities previously mentioned, and finally a form to contact us about things that made your mental health better when going through a tough time. If you could fill this section out before leaving the website that would be much appreciated. Have a great day and try to enjoy it. </p>
